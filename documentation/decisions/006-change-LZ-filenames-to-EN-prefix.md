# 006: Filenames for Learning Goals should begin with LG

## Status: Accepted

## Context 
Until now, filenames of learning goals had the prefix "LZ" (Lernziel), from the German word.

These shall be changed to the English version LG.

## Rationale:

We have an international audience, and the German prefix might be misleading for some people.

## Consequences:

Have to update the following:

- build script (`/scripts/includeLearningGoals.gradle`)
- filenames of LZ-files
- import statements
