# 002 - Keep Old LG Numbers in the 2025 Curriculum for Reference?

## Status: Accepted

## Context
We have a new structure in the upcoming 2025 curriculum, so a lot of LG (lerning goal) numbers will change.
Should we keep a reference to the old number(s) in a newly numbered LG?

## Decision

Gernot Starke and Alexander Lorz decided to keep the old LG numbers at least for 6 months after the release of the new curriculum in April 2025.

An example:

```
==== LG 03-03 [previously LG 2-01]: Select and Use Approaches
```

>Addendum October 7th 2024: In case the LG number DID NOT CHANGE from 2023 to 2025, we leave out the backreference.
    
## Rationale

The curriculum maintainers and authors of derived documents (slides, books, ...) definitely want to know what has changed from where, especially when adopting the new curriculum.

## Consequences:
* Re-evalute this decision in 2025/10 and possibly delete the reference to old LGs.
