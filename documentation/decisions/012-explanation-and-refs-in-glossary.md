# 012: Define and Explain Terms in Glossary AND Give References in Glossary 

## Status: Accepted

## Context 

In [issue 577](https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/577) we discussed our usage of the _Glossary_ as a means to define or explain terms.

We decided to:

1. give a understandable ("good") explanation in the glossary
2. add (maybe historical) references also in the glossary


## Rationale:

The list of references in the curriculum shall not become overly long - and shall contain current and easily-accessible references.
Historical references are better suited for the glosssary.

## Consequences:

See the context - there is a lot of work to be done for defining terms.
