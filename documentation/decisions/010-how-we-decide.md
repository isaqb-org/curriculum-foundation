# 010: How We Decide

## Status: Accepted

### Summary

>The Foundation-Level Working Group follows a decision process that prioritizes consensus, collaborative input, and leader-facilitated voting with clear rules for major and minor decisions, voting procedures, and documentation.


## Context 

**We make explicit how we come to conclusions or decisions.**


### 1. Leader Responsibility
The current WG-leaders (currently Gernot Starke and Alexander Lorz) will facilitate the decision-making process.
The leaders ensure progress but do not unilaterally decide.

### 2. Collaborative Input
Every group member is encouraged to participate in discussions.
Major decisions are openly discussed in GitHub Issues, and input is collected from all members.
What constitutes a major decision can be made explicit by using a GitHub label (`MAJOR`)).

### 3. Consensus Preference
The group strives for consensus, aiming for solutions that everyone can support or, at a minimum, live with.
A discussion period will be set for each major decision to allow for thorough feedback.

### 4. Rule for Minor Decisions
Minor decisions can be made by any two members if there are no objections from the rest of the group within 72 hours.
This allows for quick resolution of smaller matters without requiring full group involvement.
Such issues are tagged with the `minor` label.

### 5. Voting When Necessary
If consensus cannot be reached, the leaders can call for a vote.
Each member has one vote, and a simple majority (6 out of 10) decides the outcome.

### 6. Handling Low Voter Turnout
A vote is valid as long as a minimum of 3 members participate.
A simple majority of those who vote decides the outcome.
If fewer than 3 members vote, the leader will re-engage the team for further discussion before calling a second vote.
If the minimum is still not met in the second round, the leader and the available voters will make the decision.

### 7. Leaderâ€™s Tie-breaking Role
In case of a tie, the leader has the tie-breaking vote.

### 8. Documentation of Decisions
All decisions must be documented as an ADR in the repository. Each ADR should summarize the decision, its rationale, and its expected impact.

### 9. Reevaluation
Decisions can be revisited if new information or circumstances arise.
Any member can propose a reevaluation by opening a GitHub Issue.

## Rationale:

Even in an organization like iSAQB there should be an agreement on the _modus operandi_, the ways we work.
For the curriculum this might be critical, as more than 2500 people take the respective classes every year, giving the FLWG a great responsibility.

## Consequences:

* create [labels `major` and `minor` in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/labels).
