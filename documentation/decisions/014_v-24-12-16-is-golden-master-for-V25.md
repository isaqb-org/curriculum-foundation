# 014: Version of Dezenber 16th 2024 shall be _golden master_ for upcoming release V2025

## Status: Accepted

## Context:

In the status call of December 16th 2024 the FLWG decided to freeze all (of the few) open issues
and use the current state (commit ID cd8521661da15d2713f4a671ec53227bc572ae75) as golden master,
(aka final release candidate)
which shall be given to all trainers and training providers, so they can start adjusting their training material.


## Rationale:

We need to deliver content, otherwise we will break the planned schedule.

## Consequences:

- LG 01-07 on data and data modelling will currently NOT be split (as was originally proposed by Mike Sperber.)
