# 005: Both English and German References are accepted

## Status: Accepted

## Context 
Until further notice (at least for V-2025) we accept both German and English references and books.

## Rationale:

We currently have more than 3500 German certifications and 1000 in English. 
That vast amount of German language participants justifies German references.
 
## Consequences:

We keep the current state of the reference list, both German and English.
