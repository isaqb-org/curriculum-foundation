# 007: Distinct References Section Per LG

## Status: Accepted

## Context 
We have a section for references per learning goal.

## Rationale:

In previous versions of the curriculum we kept references (books, websites) per section of the curriculum.
It was difficult (if not impossible) to find out which of these references was useful for which part of the content.

Therefore we switched to more specific references.

## Consequences:
