# 008: Architects are able to specify quality requirements

## Status: Accepted

## Context 
Within the FOUNDATION level working group we had long (aka _endless_) discussions about quality and quality requirements.
Conclusion is:

* Software architects shall be able to formulate precise quality requirements, i.e. as quality scenarios.
* The shall not _invent_ these, but formulate in cooperation or collaboration with other stakeholders.
 
## Rationale:

* The ability to formulate such requirements in precise and practically usable ways is part of many CPSA-Advanced level certifications, therefore it *must* be taught and practiced within foundation level trainings.


## Consequences:

We discussed this topic within GitHub issues:

* [#597](https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/597) proposed a somewhat weaker formulation (_know how to formulate scenarios..._). We decided to keep the existing "_are able to_".
* In [#501](https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/501) we decided to elevate quality scenarios to R1.
