# 011 - Treat Socio-Technical Systems as Out of Scope

## Status: Accepted

## Context

- The Foundation Level curriculum needs to maintain focus while being already heavily loaded with content
- There's an ongoing discussion about reintroducing content about software lifecycle and system evolution
- Historical learning goal LG 1-3 (2023 curriclum) about software architecture in the lifecycle was previously removed
- A LG about socio-technical systems would open up a wide field of discussions about feedback loops, including Lehman's Laws and organizational relationships
- The curriculum aims to provide essential knowledge for software architects while keeping content manageable

## Decision

We will treat socio-technical systems as out of scope for the Foundation Level curriculum but (re-)introduce a LG about the long term impact of software architecture where we keep a reference to this advanced topic.

## Rationale

- The Foundation Level curriculum is already at capacity ("fully packed")
- Core technical concepts need to be thoroughly understood before addressing complex socio-technical interactions
- While important, socio-technical systems are better suited for Advanced Level modules where students have already mastered technical fundamentals
- The topic involves complex theories (Lehman's Laws, Theory U) that require significant time to cover properly
- Even experts in the field rarely encounter some of these theoretical frameworks in practice
- The fundamentals of change and evolution can be covered without diving deep into socio-technical theory

## Consequences

- reintroduce LG about the long term impact of SWA to the curriculum
- add at least a reference to Lehmann's Law in the reference section of this LG
