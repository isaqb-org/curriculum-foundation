* Several LGs received major updates:
** Update goals of software architecture (LG 1-2)
** Update influencing factors (LG 2-3)
** Update patterns (LG 2-5)
** Update design principles (LG 2-6)
* Several learning goals now contain a brief explanation (e.g. LG 2-5 on patterns) to clarify their content
* Update gendering (DE version only)
* Fix numerous bugs and inconsistencies, many slight wording changes
* Add LG 1-11 on "Challenges of distributed systems (R3)"
* Version and validity date now in document footer

== Detailed Changelog (curated)
For the complete changelog, see the git commit history. The numbers (like #196) refer to the GitHub issues.

The numbers (like #196) refer to the GitHub issues. RC3 and RC4 fix a few typos and weaknesses/omissions in formulations of LGs.

* Prerequisites have been clarified, "object-oriented language" has been replaced by "higher-level language"

* LG 1-2 received additional sub-goals and explanation
* LG 1-2 unified wording, to “goals and benefits” (https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/192[#192])

* LG 1-5 more consistent wording (https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/196[#196])

* LG 1-11 has been added (R3), naming some characteristics and challenges of distributed systems

* LG 2-1 mentions additional architecture "methods" (Evolutionary Architecture, Global-Analysis), all R3. Better indication which method has which exam relevance

* LG 2-3 major overhaul: new structure of LG, new and explicit collection of influencing factors

* LG 2-5 completely restructured list of patterns. A few R1, many optional R3. R1 now covers Microservices and Dependency Injection (yes, after lengthy discussions we decided to add it as a fundamental pattern here. Please note: The list of optional R3 patterns give trainers the opportunity to add specific content as needed.
* LG 2-5 removed “Self-contained systems” from microservice pattern, as these two are not the same thing, https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/204[#204]
* LG 2-5 removed duplicate sentence (https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/194[#194])

* LG 2-6 completely restructured ist of design principles. As we consider this topic to be one of the most important in architecture education, we collected all the fundamental principles in a modular structure. Trainers most likely will have to adapt training material to this new and enhanced LG.
* LG 2-6 fixed translation of “expect errors”, https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/202[#202]
* LG 2-6 rephrased “conceptual integrity”, https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/202[#202]
* LG 2-6 fixed several wrong relevance-levels on sub-learning-goal headings

* LG 2-7 rephrased coupling-types (https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/197[#197])
* LG 2-7 added “messaging/events” to list of coupling types, https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/201[#201]
* LG 2-7 renamed LG to “managing dependencies” (instead of “planning dependencies”, https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/195[#195])
* LG 2-7 add messaging/events to coupling types

* LG 2-8 changed wording from “design tactics” to “architectural tactics”

* LG 3-2 improved wording, explained the need for specific adaption of documentation

* LG 3-3 demoted a few diagram types to R3, ArchiMate has been added to the list
* LG 3-3 added reference to ArchiMate (https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/146[#146], https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/147[#147], https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/191[#191])

* LG 3-6 demoted “documenting cross-cutting concepts” to R2 (https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/186[#186])

* LG 3-8 promoted “documenting architecture-decisions” to R1, added ADR (https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/187[#187])

* LG 3-10 RM/ODP has been removed, some references added



== Known Issues
* In all sections "Important terms" at the beginning of each curriculum section, numerous terms are missing the hyperlinks into the iSAQB glossary.
* On macOS, the hyperlinks to the iSAQB glossary within PDF documents fail in the standard "Preview" app. Firefox and AcrobatReader work fine. See https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/189
