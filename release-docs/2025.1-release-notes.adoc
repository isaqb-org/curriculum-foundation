== Brief Summary of Changes Between 2021.1 amd 2025.1
* Major changes to both the structure and the content.
* The structure of the entire document was changed primarily to separate the topics of "Quality / Requirements" from "Architecture Assessment", which were previously in one chapter "4. Software Architecture and Quality".
* Many of the individual learning goals were relocated to other chapters, to combine topics that logically belonged together.
* At least 50% of the syllabus was changed
* The exam-relevance of several learning goals were demoted or promoted.
* Every chapter now includes a "Purpose" statement
* References were added to each learning goal, where applicable
* Terms were linked to a corresponding description in the iSAQB Glossary, where appropriate.

== Detailed Changelog (curated)
For the complete changelog, see the git commit history. The numbers (like #196) refer to the GitHub issues.

** The impacts of changes to the software architecture on other things as well as the impact of other things on software architecture is stressed.
** "Importance of Data and Data Models" was added.
** "Cross-cutting concepts" was renamed to "cross-cutting concerns"
** The learning goal "Differentiate between types of IT systems" has been completely removed.

** Previously LG 1-5.
** Minor changes to the list of stakeholders

* LG 01-07: Importance of Data and Data Models (R2)

** Previously LG 1-8. Reworded for clarity.

* LG 03-00 Chapter 3: Design and Development of Software Architectures
** Stresses that the architecture should fulfill the requirements.
** Examples of quality requirements was removed.

** There is now a differentiation between "cross-cutting concerns" and "cross-cutting concepts"."

* LG 03-01: 
** Previously LG 2-8
** New content. Stresses that the architecture should fulfill the requirements as well as identifying trade-offs between designs and associated risks.
