# Changes in 2025.1

The baseline for the following comparison is the latest release of 2023.1

The list of fixed/resolved issues can be found in the [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/isaqb-org/projects/7/views/1) on GitHub.
For 2025.1, we have resolved more than 60 issues, comments and problems in both the English (EN) and German (DE) version.

## Very Short Summary

* The structure of the curriculum has been aligned with the architectural tasks (clarify requirements, design the system, communicate, evaluate/analyze)
* As a consequence, many learning goals have been moved.
* Examination-relevant content largely remained unchanged.
* Many LGs got new numbers, but the old numbers are kept in the title to facilitate migration.
