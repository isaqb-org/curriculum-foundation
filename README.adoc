== What's CPSA-Foundation?

Education based upon the _Certified Professional for Software Architecture â€“ Foundation Level (CPSA-F)_ shall provide participants with the knowledge and skills required to design, specify and document software architectures adequate to fulfil the respective requirements for small and medium-sized systems.


=== What does "Foundation Level" cover?

As stated above, _Foundation Level_ covers small to medium-sized software systems.

Based upon their individual practical experience and existing skills, participants will learn to derive architectural decisions from an existing system vision and adequately detailed requirements.
CPSA-F trainings teach methods, principles and patterns for design, communication, documentation and evaluation of software architectures, independent of specific development processes.
The CPSA-F curriculum is technology-neutral, therefore applicable to a borad range or

Focus is education and training of the following skills:

* Discuss and reconcile fundamental architectural decisions with stakeholders from requirements, management, development, operations and test,
* understand the essential activities of software architecture, and carry out those for small- to medium sized systems,
* document and communicate software architectures based upon architectural views, architecture patterns and technical concepts

In addition, such trainings cover

* the tasks and responsibilities of software architect
* the term software architecture and its meaning
* the roles of software architects within development
* state-of-the-art methods and techniques for developing software architectures

=== What constitutes a _Curriculum_


> A curriculum, in contrast to a _syllabus_, is oriented towards teaching objectives and the course of the teaching and learning process. 
> In addition to the teaching content, the urriculum should include regulations and options for learning processes and the organization of learning.

== Goals and Requirements

=== Content Requirements
==== What Constitutes _Good Learning Goals_

The following requirements should be fulfilled by every learning goal, especially for all R1-goals:

Specific and Clear:: 
  Each learning goal should be clear and specific, avoiding vagueness. 
This means stating what the learner will know or be able to do in precise terms. 
For software architects, this could involve specifying particular architectural styles, patterns, methods and practices they will need to learn and apply.

Relevant:: 
  Learning goals should be directly relevant to the roles and responsibilities of software architects. 
  This means they should focus on skills and knowledge that are directly applicable to designing, evaluating, and managing software architecture. 
  Relevance also includes ensuring that the goals are aligned with current industry standards, technologies, and practices to prepare learners for real-world challenges.

Authoritative:: 
  Learning goals should be <<handling-references, based on established content>> industry best practices, and proven research. 
  This ensures that the curriculum is aligned with recognized standards and that students are learning concepts that are widely accepted and validated in the field of software architecture.
  Where possible and adequate, authorative sources shall be referenced.

Measurable::
  Goals must be measurable so that both the learner and the educator can assess progress. 
This involves defining criteria for success, which can be quantified or qualified. For instance, a learning goal might include being able to design a complete software architecture that meets defined performance metrics or adhering to specific architectural principles.

Achievable::
  While learning goals should be challenging, they must also be attainable within the scope of the course or program. 
This requires considering the learners' current skill levels and the resources available to support their learning. 
Goals that are too ambitious may discourage learners, while those that are too easy may not lead to significant learning or skill development.


=== Important Terms Defined in Glossary

All _important terms_ from the curriculum shall be defined in the (freely available) glossary. 

Where useful, the curriculum shall contain hyperlinks from these terms to the online version of this glossary.


=== Process Requirements

==== Open and Transparent Development

Maintenance of this content shall be open and transparent, done on a public platform (like GitHub):

Open::
  We encourage contributions from a broad community. 
  This can include reporting issues or change-requests, submitting changes, or suggesting new content.

Transparent::
   The processes, decisions, and discussions surrounding the development of this curriculum are open for public viewing. 
   These transparen practices ensure that contributors and maintainers are accountable for their actions. 
   Readers, consumers and contributors can see who made specific changes, when they were made, and why.

Together, openness and transparency shall ensure that the development of this curriculum is inclusive, collaborative, and accountable.
That shall lead to a trust and acceptance of the whole content.

=== The Foundation-Level Working Group (FLWG)

image::documentation/FLWG-logo.png[]

The FLWG (Foundation Level Working Group) consists of volunteer members of iSAQB who take up the responsibility of maintaining the curriculum plus the corresponding examination (including questions, question-formats and examination rules).


Currently the FLWG consists of >10 <<maintainers,maintainers>> from industry and academia, with a background from many kinds of software systems.


=== Version History

This repository contains the *curriculum* for CPSA-F in the following versions:

* **(upcoming) version 2025 (will become mandatory from April 1^st^ 2025)**
* Version 2023 (mandatory from April 1^st^ 2023)
* Version 2021.1 (mandatory from April 1^st^ 2021)
* Version 5 (mandatory from September 1^st^ 2019 until March 31^st^ 2021)


=== Update and Release Process


We follow a standardized update and release process for the curriculum and the associated examination questions.

Please note the semantics of several terms:

Version-Identifier::
    Official versions of the curriculum are identified using a specific version-string.
    `{Release-Year}.{Update}-{Revision}-{Language}-{timestamp}`, for example `2023.1-rev2-EN-20230321`.
    In preparation for releases (see below), release-candidates are produced and labelled with RC1, RC2 etc.

Revision::
  In case of typos or other minor grammatical changes, we will release revisions (aka patches) without increasing the minor version. 
  They will be tagged as revisions (e.g. `2023.1-rev3`) on GitHub and receive a new timestamp, resulting in a version in a document that looks like this: `2023.1-rev3-EN-20230928` (revision update on Sep 28, 2023).
We strive to keep learning content and structure stable across such updates, meaning that no training provider needs to adjust training material in case of revision updates.

Update::
    In case of errors or omissions (e.g. translation issues, required updates for certain references, clarification of certain wordings or similar), an updated (aka _fixed_ or _repaired_) version of the curriculum is produced.
    For such updates we increase the second part (minor version id) of the curriculum (e.g. going from `2021.1` to `2021.2`).
    Those updates may affect multiple language versions and will reset the revision number to 0.

Release::
    Every two years the FLWG releases a new version of the curriculum. 
    Releases usually contain major changes to the content of the curriculum.
    For example, learning goals might be re-formulated, deleted or new content might be added.

> You find a [detailed explanation here](https://github.com/isaqb-org/github-readme?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-create-a-new-release-of-a-curriculum)


[IMPORTANT] 
.Releases impact training material
==== 
_Releases_ will impact structure and content of training material. 
Therefore, training providers, translation agencies and the examination commission will be notified about these releases, so they can adjust their trainings, translations or the exam questions, respectively.
====

If you <<build, build>> the curriculum locally, the version string will be set to `local build`.

* Announcements: major versions (2019.x, 2021.x) are announced to training providers at least 3-4 month in advance--usually at the iSAQB members meeting.
* RC1: About 4-6 month prior to release, training providers receive the first release candidate (RC1) for review and comments.
* RC2: 6-8 weeks prior to release they receive the final release candidate RC2, which is _feature frozen_ (meaning neither learning goals nor priorities will substantially change, only bugs and typos will be fixed).
* Final version (e.g. 2021.1) will be made public on iSAQB.org and iSAQB.com
* Released versions will be tagged in git.

All languages (e.g. DE and EN) will be released at the same time.

== Technical Information

[[build]]
=== How to Build (aka: Generate) the Documents


Prerequisite: You need an up-to-date Java Runtime(tm) installed. Ubuntu's default Java 11 is not sufficient, Java 21 works.

You build the output documents with https://gradle.org[gradle]. 
That will produce both pdf and html output in German (DE) _and_ English (EN), unless you modify the configuration. 
Make sure to use the Gradle Wrapper in this repository to prevent potential build errors.


`./gradle-tools/gradlew buildDocs`

In case you want to change the configuration, adjust the following part of `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
ext {
    curriculumFileName = "curriculum-foundation"
    validity = project.file("./document.validity").text.trim()
    languages = ["DE", "EN"]
}
----

Please note: You need to include the submodules "pdf-theme", "html-theme", "license-copyright", and "gradle-tools" in your checkout, otherwise the build will fail. You can do that with the following commands:

. Clone the repository - including the submodule:
+
--
[source,shell]
----
Via SSH:
git clone git@github.com:isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation.git --recursive

Via HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation.git --recursive
----
--
. Initialize and update submodules with `git submodule init` and `git submodule update --recursive --remote`. Do this also after you pulled changes that added a new submodule.
. Cleanup leftover files (make sure to commit your changes first!): `git clean -xdf` -- *Attention:* This will also delete your local IDE settings (VScode, IntelliJ, etc.)
. Cleanup your local repository from time to time: `git gc --aggressive`

=== How to Create an Official Version (by tagging in Git)

If you consider the status of the curriculum worthy of a new release or release candidate, you have to create a `tag` with your *local* Git client (*not* via GitHub).

The format for a release candidate tag is as follows: +
`2025.1-RCX`, where x is either 1 or the current release candidate number increased by one. +
This tag will create a GitHub _pre-release_. They are [available here](https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/releases) and provide you with a zip archive that contains the curriculum as PDF and HTML. +


The format for a release tag is as follows: +
`2025.1-revX` where x is either 0 (initial release), or the current revision increased by one. +
This tag will create a GitHub _Release_. They are [available here](https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/releases) and provide you with a zip archive that contains the curriculum as PDF and HTML.
In addition, the released curriculum will be published on GitHub Pages. +

The particular language as well as the timestamp will be added automatically.

Example for a full version in the English curriculum PDF: `2023.1-rev0-EN-20230301`


== Content and Style

=== Writing Style

==== Heading Capitalization

In https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/246 we decided to use title case for all headings:

* capitalize: first and last word, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs
* lowercase: articles and prepositions

When in doubt, opt for https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/Chicago/[Chicago Style].

==== Bullet Point Lists

To unify upper/lowercase within the (EN) version, we use the _Chicago manual of style proposal_":

* short bullet items don't get a full-stop
* next one starts lowercase
* if bullets are phrases or fragments, dont use punctuation
* if and only if an item is a really long sentence which deserves a full stop, or consists of several sentences, then we use it.
* Only then does an item start with uppercase.

For the German (DE) version, we don't use punctuation at the end of bullet-list items, unless on ends-of-sentences.

==== Citation Keys and Bibliographic Reference

We follow standardized citation keys:

* Single author: `[lastname YYYY]`, e.g. `[Starke 2024]`
* Multiple authors: `[lastname+YYYY]`, e.g. `[Bass+2021]`
* Standards: `[standard-id]`, e.g. `[ISO 25010:2023]`
* Known terms/products: `[abbreviation]`, e.g. `[arc42]`

See decision 012 for complete guidelines and special cases.

We follow IEEE style for bibliograpy entries:

* Books: [key] A. Author, B. Author, and C. Author, _Title of Book_, nth ed. City, State: Publisher, Year.
* Online Resources: [key] Organization, "Title of webpage." [Online]. Available: https://url.com
* Journal/Conference Papers: [key] A. Author and B. Author, "Title of paper," _Name of Journal,_ vol. x, no. x, pp. xxx-xxx, Month Year.

See decision 015 and the [IEEE style guide reference](http://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE_Reference_Guide.pdf) for furher details. 

[[handling-references]]
=== Based on Established Content And References
We strive to base all content on established content by providing references to original sources.

In practice, this means that we reference the original source of a learning goal, if it is based on a book, a paper, a standard or similar.
We use a distinct section for every learning goal:

 
```
===== {references}
<<starkelorz>>
``` 

Example (abbreviated)
----
[[LG-01-01]]
==== LG 01-01: Discuss Definitions of Software Architecture (R1)

Software architects know the commonalities of many definitions of software architecture:

* ...
* ...
